# Alphaid Bot [![Crowdin](https://d322cqt584bo4o.cloudfront.net/snowball-bot/localized.svg)](https://crowdin.com/project/snowball-bot) [![License: MIT](https://img.shields.io/badge/license-MIT-green.svg)](LICENSE)

A better version of the original Snowball Bot for [Discord](https://discordapp.com/). Modular, advanced and configurable.

Created using [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/), [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/) and [discord.js library](https://discord.js.org/). *Inspired by [Minecraft Forge](https://github.com/MinecraftForge) a little.*
